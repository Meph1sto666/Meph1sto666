# About me

Hey there, I'm Mephi, glad you made it here :D

Since I'm a ~~lazy~~ efficiency orientated programmer I love to automate processes especially downloads and QOL applications (mostly regarding my music and weeb stuff addiction).

I tend to neglect my projects though I'm eager to learn and try new things all the time. Mainly focussing on languages, mathematical and logical concepts as well as an increasing interest in reverse engineering.

Feel free to contact me on Discord `@meph1sto666` or per E-Mail though I might be a little slow to respond to mails.
